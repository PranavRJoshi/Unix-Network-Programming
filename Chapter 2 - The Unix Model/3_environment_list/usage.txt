To run the program:
  ->  To prepare the executable, run the `make` command.
  ->  To check the environment variable of the executable by either using 
      `./environ` or `./environ2`.
      The programs are equivalent, except for the fact that `./environ` has the 
      `envp` variable declared as the function parameter of main, while `./environ2`
      uses the external variable defined by the startup function which calls main to 
      execute the process.

      The programs can accept arguments in the executables.
  ->  To remove the executable, run the `make clean` command.
