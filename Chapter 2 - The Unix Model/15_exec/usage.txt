To run the program:
  ->  Prepare the executable using the `make` command in the current working directory.
  ->  This will make two executables, `./exec` and `./dummy`
  ->  The program illustrates the usage of the `exec` family of system calls used to execute another process.
  ->  The `./exec` depends on the `./dummy` in the Makefile as the `./exec` programs runs it.
  ->  Along with running `./dummy`, the `./exec` program will also run the ls command.
  ->  To clean, run `make clean`
