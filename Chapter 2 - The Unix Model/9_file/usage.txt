To run the program:
  ->  Prepare the executable using the `make` command.
  ->  The executables prepared are `./file` and `./typeof_file`.
      `./file` will provide the stats of the source file "file.c", while
      `./typeof_file` will take in the program argument and checks the type of 
      file: regular, directory, character, block, etc. For instance, by running
      `./typeof_file file.c`, it will return what type of file is `file.c`, which 
      is regular in this case.
  ->  To remove the executable, run the `make clean` command.
