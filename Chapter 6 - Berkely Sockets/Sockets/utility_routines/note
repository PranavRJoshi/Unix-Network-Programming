Before traversing this directory, make sure that this directory was made to document the way the function described in the text works.
The three utility routines: readn, writen, and readline, are used by many applications in the text later on.
The directory connection{less|_oriented}_{client|server} contains the source code for a basic `echo` function. This, like the previous one, is used for documentation purpose.

The reason for doing this rather than making an executable straight from the function described is cause building them is difficult (for me) when having files in different directories.

For now, the only executable will be stored in the directory `../tcp` and `../udp`, illustrating the connection_oriented client/server as well as connectionless client/server respectively.

One final thing, the files in the directory `../tcp` and `../udp` lacks documentation. Rather, all the working of the code can be found in the files that are in this directory `./utility_routines/...`. This is to make sure that documentation does not clutter the code everywhere. Also, function such as `err_dump` and `err_sys` which are used in the text are not used here, it is replaced with `perror` and `exit`.
