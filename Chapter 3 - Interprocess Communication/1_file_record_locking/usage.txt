To run the program:
  ->  Prepare the executable using the `make` command.
  ->  Run the `./file_record` executable.
      
      The executable utilizes the locks from the `lock.c` file,
      which contains five different methods of file locking.

      You can modify the program by using different forms of 
      lock in the "file_record.c" where the lock is used.

      Refer to "lock.c" file to learn about different forms of 
      locking.
  ->  To remove the executable, run the `make clean` command.
