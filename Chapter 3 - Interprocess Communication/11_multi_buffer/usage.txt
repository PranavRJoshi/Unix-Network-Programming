To run the program:
  ->  Prepare the executable using the `make` command.
  ->  There will be two executables: `./client` and `./server`.
      As with other client-server programs in this chapter, the client
      takes in the name of the file from the standard input, which is 
      processed by the server and the content of the file is provided back 
      to the client, which is written to the standard output.

      This program utilizes the multiple-buffer technique to replicate the
      asynchoronous reading of the file.
  ->  To remove the executable, run the `make clean` command.
