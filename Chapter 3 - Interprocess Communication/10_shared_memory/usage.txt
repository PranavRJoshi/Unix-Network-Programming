To run the program:
  ->  Prepare the executable using the `make` command.
  ->  There will be two executables, `./client` and `./server`.
      `./server` is run first. Whilst the server is up, the client 
      is run using `./client`. The client is expected to provide the 
      name of the file whose content is to be written in the standard 
      output.

      This code implements the shared memory technique, along with 
      semaphores as a synchronization mechanism.
      
      The code contains explaination as to how it functions. Refer to 
      the source file.
  ->  To remove the executable, run the `make clean` command.
