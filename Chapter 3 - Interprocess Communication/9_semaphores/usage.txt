To run the program:
  ->  Prepare the executable using the `make` command.
  ->  This will create an executable `./main`, whose functionality is described 
      briefly in the source file. 

      NOTE: The `pitfalls` directory contains code that illustrate the problems with
      using semaphores without any precautions. Check the source files in that directory
      to learn more about the danger of not using semaphores properly.
  ->  To remove the executable, run the `make clean` command.
