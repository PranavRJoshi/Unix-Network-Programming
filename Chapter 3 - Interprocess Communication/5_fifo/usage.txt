To run the program:
  ->  Prepare the executable using the `make` command.
  ->  There will be two executables: `./fifo_client` and `./fifo_server`
      
      NOTE: By default, the executables mentioned above is created, but we can 
      also create a single executable using the `make main` command.

      The source file contains the detail functionality of the program.

  ->  To remove the executables:
      1. If the default `make` is used, use the `make clean` command.
      2. If `make main` command is used, use the `make cleanmain` command.
